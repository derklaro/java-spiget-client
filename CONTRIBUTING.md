How to contribute
========

We all love open source and work others put into projects. We'd love to accept patches from you. There are some small
things you should do before contributing to this project.

### A new feature

If you want to add a new feature to the project it might be a good idea to open an issue and describe the feature before
writing the code and getting rejected because the feature is not needed. If you are convinced that the feature is so
good of an idea that no discussion is necessary to add it - feel free to do so.

### Submitting a pull request

There is a checklist of things you should do before submitting a pull request. This checklist will be there when you
create it. Ensure that you can tick everything on that list - except for the situation of creating a draft pull request.
In this case ensure you can tick everything before clicking on "Ready for review". Here are all points you should
consider done:

- The issue I fixed/closed with the pr is linked to it (if there is an issue)
- My code follows the style guidelines
- I have added documentation to all new methods and updated the existing ones if necessary
- The changes do not lead to compilation warnings which are resolvable
- I added test for the new code I've added to the project
- New and existing unit tests pass with the proposed changes
- This pull request has no conflicts with the base branch (preferably a linear history)
